Here are some of the academic projects I have worked on during my time at Bentley University's MS Business Analytics:
1) Data Assignment - Time Series Analysis of a 2 yr dataset of Amazon's Wikipedia page visits, includes a 2 wk visit forecast using a Holt-Winters model
2) Random Forest for Toyota Corolla Pricing - Regresssion Tree model to understand the most relevant underlying factors for pricing of 14,000 Toyota Corolla vehicles
