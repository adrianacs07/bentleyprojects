Here are some of the academic projects I have worked on during my time at Bentley University's MS Business Analytics program:

2) Random Forest for Toyota Corolla Pricing - Regression Tree model to understand the most relevant underlying factors for pricing of 14,000 Toyota Corolla vehicles
3) Bank Marketing Campaign - EDA and Poisson Regression model to understand the factors behind the number of successful marketing efforts during a campaign
4) US Air Enplanements - Time Series Analysis of a 20+ yr dataset, which includes a 2 yr forecast using a Holt-Winters model
